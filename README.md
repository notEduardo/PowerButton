# PowerButton

This is a tool I created for myself, but I figured someone else might find it useful. 

It's a bash script that does has two states. 

First, when you arrive, you "PowerOn" which unhides all the files/folders on the desktop. It also greets you with Good "Morning", "Afternoon", or "Evening" depending on the time. Lastly, it reads out the time.

Second, when you leave, you "PowerOff" which hides all the files/filders on the desktop. It also quits all open applications, and hides all open finder windows. Lastly, it says goodbye and wishes you a Good "Morning", "Afternoon", or "Evening" depending on the time.
